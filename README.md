## Motivation üöÄ

If you have an idea and want to quickly build a Proof of Concept (PoC) or Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to test the market, ChadNext can help you overcome several pain points:

- Finding a high-performing full-stack framework
- Finding a beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable modern UI library

By addressing these pain points, ChadNext saves you time and effort, providing a solid starter template for building performant apps with an excellent developer experience.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

ChadNext utilizes the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A full-stack React framework to build high-performing apps with zero configuration.
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable component library made with **Radix UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and many battle-tested libraries like **React Table**, **React Hook Form**, **Zod**, etc.
- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) - An easy and simple authentication solution.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - A simple, cool type-safe ORM.
- [Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) - Postgres is one of the best SQL databases. ChadNext is using **Vercel Postgres**, which is scalable and secure by default.
- [Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) - To get privacy-friendly, real-time traffic insights, ChadNext is using **Vercel Analytics**.
- [Deployment](https://vercel.com/) - ChadNext is using Vercel for deployment, which helps you focus on development only, handling all the complexity of deployment, including automatic preview for every commit and branch.
- [Linting](https://eslint.org/) & [Formatting](https://prettier.io/) - ChadNext uses Eslint to keep the code consistent and Prettier to keep the code readable. It also uses Husky to ensure all the linting and formatting before every commit.
- and Of course, Type safety with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

By using **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as a PaaS**, ChadNext reduces the pain of finding and adding solutions for the database, analytics, and deployment. We can focus only on development.

So, now you can build and deploy the product of your idea quickly and analyze the market.

A: ChadNext provides a comprehensive set of features, including a UI component library, authentication, database integration, analytics, and deployment. It offers a quick start with a minimal setup, leveraging the power of Next.js, a full-stack React framework. TypeScript ensures type safety, and linting and formatting tools maintain code consistency and readability. I didn't find any template combining all of these together.
